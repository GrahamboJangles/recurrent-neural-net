# Reccurent neural network

This program will learn to produce text similar to the one that
it has been training on using a recurrent neural network. 

# Comments

For now I have just started with the implementation.

I figured if it was to be implemented in C instead of Python then
there would be a huge speedup which the results show!

I will give this some time and hopefully I figure out a way that
optimizes the program even more for speed.. Until then, have a go at this 
little program and edit it as you please! 

# make

I use GCC and compile with with: 
gcc *.c -O3 -Ofast -msse3 -lm

Try to optimize it the way you want using the compiler at hand!
