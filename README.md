# Reccurent neural network

This program will learn to produce text similar to the one that
it has been training on using a recurrent neural network.

For now I have just started with the implementation, and it is 
really not as fast as I had hoped for. 

I figured if it was to be implemented in C instead of Python then
there would be a huge speedup but the results disappointed me. 

I will give this some time and hopefully I figure out a way that
optimizes the program for speed.. Until then, have a go at this 
little program and edit it as you please!
